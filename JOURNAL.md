Today I started on designing the body and charging ciruit, I'm likely going to be using pogo pins for battery to battery connection but I may use spring contacts for the charging part. After modeling the slide together design, I realized how bulky I would need to make the slides because of 3d printing durability which wouldn't look amazing. I'm considering using magnets and pogo pin combonations, though I'm unsure how strong it would be. I'm also not sure how to make the battery pack extend in more than on direction without additional costs. For wiring simplicity, I want to attach the positive terminal of the battery via wire or some connection next to the bottom so it can be easily connected, but I'm not sure of a good solution other than just running a wire down to it. If I chose to go with the sliding rail design, I would want the button pcb for connections to be a single pcb, though if I decide to do that, I either need to pay for double sided assembly which is expensive or manually solder the pogo pins which seems harder. If I wasn't moving and had my electronics stuff packed away, I would be okay with hand soldering it with my hot air station but I can't easily. Other option is making small pcbs with the pogo pins on them and have them snap off a larger board, fulfilling the minimum size requirements of JLC PCB.
